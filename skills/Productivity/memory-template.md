# Memory Template — Productivity

Create `~/productivity/memory.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Productivity Memory

## Status

status: ongoing
version: 1.0.4
last: YYYY-MM-DD
integration: pending

## Constraints

<!-- Real-life constraints that shape planning -->
<!-- Example: "School pickup at 15:00", "Back-to-back meetings Tue/Thu" -->

## Work Style

<!-- How work goes best when it goes well -->
<!-- Example: "Needs one clear top priority", "Prefers batch communication" -->

## Energy Patterns

<!-- Repeating energy windows, not one-day moods -->
<!-- Example: "Best focus 8:30-11:30", "Post-lunch low energy" -->

## Planning Preferences

<!-- Format and rhythm preferences -->
<!-- Example: "Likes weekly planning on Sunday", "Hates giant task lists" -->

## Current Friction

<!-- Structural problems worth remembering -->
<!-- Example: "Too many parallel projects", "Avoids ambiguous tasks" -->

## Review Rhythm

<!-- How they want to review/reset -->
<!-- Example: "Weekly review Friday afternoon" -->

## Notes

<!-- Short internal observations with clear value -->

## Status Values

| Value       | Meaning                                  | Behavior                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `ongoing`   | Still learning the user's system         | Gather context naturally     |
| `complete`  | Local system is in active use            | Work from the existing files |
| `paused`    | User does not want more setup questions  | Stop prompting, still help   |
| `never_ask` | User said stop asking about setup/memory | Never prompt again           |

## Principles

- Store stable patterns, not every temporary mood
- Save only what helps future prioritization or planning
- Prefer constraints and preferences over life-story detail
- If it belongs in the active system, put it in `~/productivity/` files instead of memory
