## When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants a real productivity system, not just one-off motivation. It should cover goals, projects, tasks, habits, planning, reviews, overload triage, and situation-specific constraints in one coherent operating model.

## Architecture

Productivity lives in `~/productivity/`. If `~/productivity/` does not exist yet, run `setup.md`.

```
~/productivity/
├── memory.md                 # Work style, constraints, energy, preferences
├── inbox/
│   ├── capture.md            # Quick capture before sorting
│   └── triage.md             # Triage rules and current intake
├── dashboard.md              # High-level direction and current focus
├── goals/
│   ├── active.md             # Outcome goals and milestones
│   └── someday.md            # Goals not committed yet
├── projects/
│   ├── active.md             # In-flight projects
│   └── waiting.md            # Blocked or delegated projects
├── tasks/
│   ├── next-actions.md       # Concrete next steps
│   ├── this-week.md          # This week's commitments
│   ├── waiting.md            # Waiting-for items
│   └── done.md               # Completed items worth keeping
├── habits/
│   ├── active.md             # Current habits and streak intent
│   └── friction.md           # Things that break consistency
├── planning/
│   ├── daily.md              # Daily focus and must-win
│   ├── weekly.md             # Weekly plan and protected time
│   └── focus-blocks.md       # Deep work and recovery blocks
├── reviews/
│   ├── weekly.md             # Weekly reset
│   └── monthly.md            # Monthly reflection and adjustments
├── commitments/
│   ├── promises.md           # Commitments made to self or others
│   └── delegated.md          # Handed-off work to track
├── focus/
│   ├── sessions.md           # Deep work sessions and patterns
│   └── distractions.md       # Repeating focus breakers
├── routines/
│   ├── morning.md            # Startup routine and first-hour defaults
│   └── shutdown.md           # End-of-day reset and carry-over logic
└── someday/
    └── ideas.md              # Parked ideas and optional opportunities
```

The skill should treat this as the user's productivity operating system: one trusted place for direction, commitments, execution, habits, and periodic review.

This skill should give the user a single framework that can absorb:

- goals
- projects
- tasks
- habits
- priorities
- focus sessions
- routines
- focus blocks
- reviews
- commitments
- inbox capture
- parked ideas
- bottlenecks
- context-specific adjustments

| "Help me reset my routine"      | Use `routines/` and `planning/` to simplify startup and shutdown loops                 |
| "Remember this preference"      | Save it to `~/productivity/memory.md` after explicit confirmation                      |

## Core Rules

### 1. Build One System, Not Five Competing Ones

- Prefer one trusted productivity structure over scattered notes, random task lists, and duplicated plans.
- Route goals, projects, tasks, habits, routines, focus, planning, and reviews into the right folder instead of inventing a fresh system each time.
- If the user already has a good system, adapt to it rather than replacing it for style reasons.

### 2. Start With the Real Bottleneck

- Diagnose whether the problem is priorities, overload, unclear next actions, bad estimates, weak boundaries, or low energy.
- Give the smallest useful intervention first.
- Do not prescribe a full life overhaul when the user really needs a clearer next step.

### 3. Separate Goals, Projects, and Tasks Deliberately

- Goals describe outcomes.
- Projects package the work needed to reach an outcome.
- Tasks are the next visible actions.
- Habits are repeated behaviors that support the system over time.
- Never leave a goal sitting as a vague wish without a concrete project or next action.

### 4. Adapt the System to Real Constraints

- Use the situation guides when the user's reality matters more than generic advice.
- Energy, childcare, deadlines, meetings, burnout, and ADHD constraints should shape the plan.
- A sustainable system beats an idealized one that collapses after two days.

### 5. Reviews Matter More Than Constant Replanning

- Weekly review is where the system regains trust.
- Clear stale tasks, rename vague items, and reconnect tasks to real priorities.
- If the user keeps replanning daily without progress, simplify and review instead.

### 6. Save Only Explicitly Approved Preferences

- Store work-style information only when the user explicitly asks you to save it or clearly approves.
- Before writing to `~/productivity/memory.md`, ask for confirmation.
- Never infer long-term preferences from silence, patterns, or one-off comments.

## Common Traps

- Giving motivational talk when the problem is actually structural.
- Treating every task like equal priority.
- Mixing goals, projects, and tasks in the same vague list.
- Building a perfect system the user will never maintain.
- Recommending routines that ignore the user's real context.
- Preserving stale commitments because deleting them feels uncomfortable.

## Scope

This skill ONLY:

- builds or improves a local productivity operating system
- gives productivity advice and planning frameworks
- reads included reference files for context-specific guidance
- writes to `~/productivity/` only after explicit user approval

This skill NEVER:

- accesses calendar, email, contacts, or external services by itself
- monitors or tracks behavior in the background
- infers long-term preferences from observation alone
- writes files without explicit user confirmation
- makes network requests
- modifies its own SKILL.md or auxiliary files

## External Endpoints

This skill makes NO external network requests.

| Endpoint | Data Sent | Purpose |
| -------- | --------- | ------- |
| None     | None      | N/A     |

No data is sent externally.

## Data Storage

Local files live in `~/productivity/`.

- `~/productivity/memory.md` stores approved preferences, constraints, and work-style notes
- `~/productivity/inbox/` stores fast captures and triage
- `~/productivity/dashboard.md` stores top-level direction and current focus
- `~/productivity/goals/` stores active and someday goals
- `~/productivity/projects/` stores active and waiting projects
- `~/productivity/tasks/` stores next actions, weekly commitments, waiting items, and completions
- `~/productivity/habits/` stores active habits and friction notes
- `~/productivity/planning/` stores daily plans, weekly plans, and focus blocks
- `~/productivity/reviews/` stores weekly and monthly reviews
- `~/productivity/commitments/` stores promises and delegated follow-through
- `~/productivity/focus/` stores deep-work sessions and distraction patterns
- `~/productivity/routines/` stores startup and shutdown defaults
- `~/productivity/someday/` stores parked ideas

Create or update these files only after the user confirms they want the system written locally.

## Migration

If upgrading from an older version, see `migration.md` before restructuring any existing `~/productivity/` files.
Keep legacy files until the user confirms the new system is working for them.

## Security & Privacy

**Data that leaves your machine:**

- Nothing. This skill performs no network calls.

**Data stored locally:**

- Only the productivity files the user explicitly approves in `~/productivity/`
- Work preferences, constraints, priorities, and planning artifacts the user chose to save

**This skill does NOT:**

- access internet or third-party services
- read calendar, email, contacts, or system data automatically
- run scripts or commands by itself
- monitor behavior in the background
- infer hidden preferences from passive observation

## Trust

This skill is instruction-only. It provides a local framework for productivity planning, prioritization, and review. Install it only if you are comfortable storing your own productivity notes in plain text under `~/productivity/`.
